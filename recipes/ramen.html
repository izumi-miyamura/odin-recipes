    <h3 id="how to cook">How to Cook</h3>
    <p>Rinse the chicken bones in cold water, then place them in a large
        pot with the water, pork, garlic, ginger, and green onions.</p>
    <p>Bring to the boil, removing the dirt that comes to the surface.
        Lower the heat and simmer with the pot covered for around two hours.</p>
    <p>Remove the pork, then strain off the broth, getting rid of the other ingredients.</p>
    <p>Add the soy sauce, sake, and mirin, then leave to simmer with the pot covered until ready to serve.</p>
    <p>Mix the ingredients for the chashu sauce in a large pan. Add the pork, then bring to the boil over a medium heat.
        Cover with a lid, leaving slightly open so the steam can escape, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for
        around 30 minutes, turning the meat from time to time until just a little bit of liquid is left. </p>
    <p>Remove the lid, stay with the pan, and watch the liquid simmer until bubbles start to appear.</p>
    <p>Turn the pork to cover it completely with the sauce, then remove from the pan and slice thinly.</p>
    <p>When ready to serve, cook the ramen following the instructions on the packaging.
        Divide the broth into six bowls, then add the noodles, pork, bamboo shoots, soy-marinated eggs, and green
        onions.</p>
    <p>Serve hot and enjoy!</p>
